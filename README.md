# AI For Low Light Vision

## Problem Statement:

Participants must enhance low light underwater images, track single underwater objects or segment underwater objects under challenging visual conditions and form an end-to-end vision pipeline. As a bonus task participants are expected to deploy their pipeline model on the cloud. Finally, shortlisted teams are expected to prepare a presentation for the judges

## TASK 1

Underwater Image Enhancement (Compulsory)
Every participant/team must complete this task before proceeding to the next stage.

##Objective

Develop a robust underwater image enhancement model to:
Correct color distortion
Reduce haze and scattering effects
Improve contrast and sharpness
Restore perceptual quality while preserving structural details
